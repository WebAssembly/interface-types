# Interface Types Proposal for WebAssembly

**Note: This proposal is currently inactive, with work having moved on to
the [component-model](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model) repo. This
proposal repo could become active again in the future to resume work on the
[Adapter Functions](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/FutureFeatures.md#custom-abis-via-adapter-functions)
future feature.**

This repository is a clone of github.com/WebAssembly/spec/. It is meant for
discussion, prototype specification and implementation of the Interface Types
proposal.

See the [explainer](proposals/interface-types/Explainer.md) for an in-progress 
summary of the proposal.
